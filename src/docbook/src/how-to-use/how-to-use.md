# How to use Daiyousei
This chapter contains info on how to use Daiyousei to insert sprites.

Daiyousei is a command-line program used to insert sprites to your ROM.
It is backward-compatible with mikeyk's `sprite_tool`, meaning that it is fine
to run Daiyousei on your ROM even if you have used sprite tool in the past.

If you are new to this whole thing, you should start with [setup](how-to-use/setup.html),
[the command line](how-to-use/cmd.md), and the [sprite list](how-to-use/sprite-list.html).
